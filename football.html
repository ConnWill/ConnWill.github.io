<h1> My One True Love </h1>
<p> The second I saw it, I knew it was the one. 100 yards, two end zones, two goalposts, 22 players, and nonstop contact for <br><br> 60 minutes. What's not there to love about football? Chicago is blessed with a sports team in every major American sport, <br><br> but no one captures the love and the energy of the city quite like the Chicago Bears.<br><br> <img src="https://static.clubs.nfl.com/image/private/t_new_photo_album/bears/tctbtinxve5gh7bkj28x.jpg" height="250" width="400" /> <br><br>  My father has had season tickets <br><br> since he was a kid, and they were passed down to him by his late father. Growing up when I wasn't playing baseball I was <br><br> eating, sleeping, and breathing Bears football. Needless to say I could not wait to strap on the pads. Whether it was <br><br> Pee-Wee, Pop Warner, or High School ball there wasn't a second where I didn't enjoy it. I was never the fastest or <br><br> strongest person on the field during high school ball and I didn't play all that much, but that didn't matter because the very <br><br> first day  of freshman football changed my life. I went to the biggest school in each district I was in, so when I arrived at <br><br> my high school of 4000+ kids on the first day I wasn't worried about making friends. I had a group of friends from middle <br><br> school, and we hung out with the kids from the other schools so by the time I got to high school I was practically set. My <br><br> tight knit circle of friends from high school is a rather large group of about 15 guys. I was only friends with 2 of them <br><br> before I  met the other 10+ guys either in football or through mutual friends from football. When it came to skill, as I said <br><br> I wasn't the very best so therefore I did not start. In fact I was the scout team quarterback, so every week I ran our <br><br> opponents offense against the first string defense. It was during high school football when I truly realized the importance <br><br> of the scout team. Certain guys complained after being put on scout team for the week, but I embraced it. It was our job <br><br> as the  scout team to fully prepare the starters for the coming week. However just because I embraced the scout team does <br><br> not mean I was satisfied, So I decided to try a new sport, one that went from <A HREF="rugby.html">Early Uncertainty to Present Perfection</A>. </p>
