<h1> Early Uncertainty to Present Perfection </h1>
<p> The sport of Rugby is a rising but not very well known sport in the United States. I was first introduced to it during middle <br><br> school by an old friend of mine. I thought it would be nice to have a spring sport that could get me in shape just in time for <br><br> football season. Turns out this sport called rugby became the sport I as best at. Not only did we win multiple state championships <br><br> <img src="https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DeXSWyhW4AA8nqH.jpg" height="200" width="275" />, <br><br> but I myself had multiple all-state honors. <br><br> <img src="https://d36m266ykvepgv.cloudfront.net/uploads/media/imQ8H8Vkdn/s-128-175/tornados-logo-red-blue.png" height="300" width="300" /> <br><br> This was the sport where I crossed that threshold between working hard and <br><br> playing hard. This is the sport where I finally felt a massive amount of enjoyment as a result of working my tail off. Every <br><br> time I stepped on that field I knew I was the best player out there, and I knew that I had earned it. This sport gave me a <br><br> huge boost of confidence not only in that craft, but in my mind. </p>
