<h1>Learning to Love but Also to Hate</h1>
<p> In some ways I could say baseball was my first love, but that was really only the case because I could start playing the <br><br> earliest, which was coincidentally the year after my team, <em> The Chicago White Sox </em> won a <strong> World Series</strong>. <br><br> <img src="https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_736,h_485,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsouthsideshowdown.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fgetty-images%2F2017%2F10%2F56038395-world-series-game-4-chicago-white-sox-v-houston-astros.jpg-850x560.jpg" height="250" width="400" /> <br><br>  I started playing Little League when I was 5 years old, which for my city was the Tee-ball league. After Tee-Ball was <br><br> "coach pitch", then farm league, C league, B league and finally, the A league. My passion for the game and drive to be <br><br> better really jumped into gear when I had an opportunity to skip from C league to A league. The managers for the teams <br><br> held a draft every year to decide teams. It was at that draft where I skipped the B League and began to take myself <br><br> seriously, and for that very reason it was at that draft where my love for baseball began to crumble. <br><br> <strong> TRAVEL TEAMS, HITTING LESSONS, PITCHING LESSONS </strong> where does it end? Between the ages of 7-10 I spent <br><br> countless hours at lessons, countless weekends at tournaments, and very little time to remember exactly why I was doing <br><br> it. After the age of 10-11 my interest in playing and in many cases watching baseball came to an end, and I never played <br><br> it again. It wasn't all bad though, excelling at the game of baseball taught me that hard work really does pay off, and <br><br> sooner or later you will enjoy the countless hours perfecting your craft.<br><br> I was going to find that <A HREF="football.html">One True Love</A>. </p>
